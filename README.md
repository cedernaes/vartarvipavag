# 🚂 Journey Tracker

A real-time web application for tracking and visualizing our traveling adventures. Built with React + TypeScript frontend and Node.js + Express backend.

## 👫 About Us

We (Sara and Erasmus) try to go on an Interrail trip each year. We built this  web app because we wanted to play around with different vibe coding tools, and it has been appreciated by our friends and family to follow us on our adventures.

## 🚀 Quick development setup

1. **Clone and install**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vartarvipavag
   npm run install:all
   ```

2. **Configure data source** (optional)
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory to control which data source to use:
   
   ```bash
   # Backend URL - defaults to http://localhost:3001 if not set
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-domain.com/vartarvipavag
   ```

3. **Start development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   **Build**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend: http://localhost:3001 (if using 'local' mode)

## Deployment

Configure NGINX and Homeassistant as described in [./config/README.md](./config/README.md), and then download the pre-built docker image (or build it yourself) for the server:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/emanuelen5/vartarvipavag-server:main
docker run --rm -p 3001:3001 --volume $(pwd)/data:/data ghcr.io/emanuelen5/vartarvipavag-server:main
```

Then you need to also host the client / front-end somewhere (like through Github pages, as we do).

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to set the Github repository secret `API_URL` to the URL of your backend if you build yourself for Github pages.

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Frontend (React + TypeScript)**
- Interactive map with React-Leaflet
- Real-time position updates
- Journey statistics and visualization
- Responsive design for mobile

**Backend (Node.js + Express)**
- RESTful API with TypeScript
- SQLite database for position storage
- Security middleware (write access restricted to localhost)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, React-Leaflet, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, SQLite, TypeScript
- **Map**: OpenStreetMap tiles via Leaflet
- **Deployment**: Docker support included

## 📱 Features

- **Real-time Map**: Interactive visualization of the journey
- **Position Classification**: Night stops vs daily positions
- **Journey Stats**: Distance, duration, and position tracking
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design for on-the-go updates

## 🔐 Security

Read operations (map viewing) are public, write operations (adding positions) are restricted to localhost for Home Assistant integration.

### Admin Mode

Admin mode allows deleting incorrectly logged positions and is only accessible from the local network. To access admin login, use one of these URLs:

- `?admin=true` - Add to the login URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000?admin=true`)
- `#admin` - Add as a hash to the URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000#admin`)

The admin option will only appear when accessed through these special URLs. Admin password is configured via `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable on the server.
